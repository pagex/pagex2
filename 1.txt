#git add .
#git commit -m "These are my new changes"
#git push # This would update my repo on github
#{enter password}
#git push heroku master # This would push to my app on heroku
#{enter password}

#git remote show origin # copy down the heroku URL
#git remote rm origin
#git remote add origin [github URL]
#git remote add heroku [heroku URL]

#Steps to link heroku on new computer
#git remote -v if heroku is not there add manually:
#git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:pagex2.git
#Heroku links your projects based on the heroku git remote (and a few other options, see the update below). To add your Heroku remote as a remote in your current repository, use the following command:
#git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:project.git
#where project is the name of your Heroku project (the same as the project.heroku.com subdomain). Once you've done so, you can use the heroku xxxx commands (assuming you have the Heroku Toolbelt installed), and can push to Heroku as usual via git push heroku master. As a shortcut, if you're using the command line tool, you can type:
#heroku git:remote -a project
#where, again, project is the name of your Heroku project (thanks, Colonel Panic). You can name the Git remote anything you want by passing -r remote_name.

#if issues to heroku push with KEYS  - heroku keys:clear create new keys with paraphrase not emtpy - heroku keys:add "pathtokey"

#I had the same issue, the steps below worked for me,
#->heroku login
#abc@gmail.com & password
#->cd C:\Users\yourusername\.ssh
#->ssh-keygen -t rsa -f id_rsa
#if asks any passphrase don't use blank, fill with a passphrase,but not forget it.
#->heroku keys:add "id_rsa.pub"
#change directory to workspace, than
#->git clone git@heroku.com:stark-dawn-1234.git -o heroku
#use passphrase that you set above.

#current keys are in heroku keys:add "c:\users\username\.ssh\id_rsa.pub" passphrase: heroku
